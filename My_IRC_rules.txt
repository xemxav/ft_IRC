My IRC Rules:

Channells:
	* Channels names are strings (beginning with a ’&’ or ’#’ character) of length up to 200 characters.
	* Channels names starts with a '#'
	* the only restriction on a channel name is that it may not contain any spaces (’ ’), a control G (^G or ASCII 7), or a comma
	-> Controlled by the client

Nick :
	* max 9 Chars
	* link to fd

Command management:
	* starts with /
	* /join + #chan_name
	* /who -> gives the list of users
	* /connect
	* /msg <nick> <message> -> send a direct message to <nick>
